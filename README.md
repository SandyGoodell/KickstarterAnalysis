# KickstarterAnalysis
For this week's homework, we were to organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends. 

Getting funded on **Kickstarter** requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. 

The StarterBook Workbook includes 4 tabs
1. ByMonth - Pivot table and chart showing the State of the counts of Projects by month with filters for categories and years
2. SubCategories - Pivot table and chart showing the counts of projects by subcategory and filter by country 
3. Category - Pivot table and chart showing the counts of projects by Category and filter by country
4. Data Sheet
5. BonusHomework

**Responses to Questions**
1. Three conclusions -  
    - Of all the projects - 53% were successful, 37% failed, 8.5% were cancelled and 1% were live
    - Theartre projects had the highest number of projects  
    - Music and the highest success rate (77%) of its    and journalism had 100% of its    canceled  
2. Limitations of data -  
   The State was not well defined and you were unable to quantify based on the parameters for each state
   Also, it was not clear why the goal amount were set and made it difficult to analyse and what was done with overfunding
3. Analysis of Backers and average amounts contributed, also some completion days
